# Step 6: Slicing ‚úÇÔ∏èüçï

<ul class="roundbox">
<p>Hospital X  has additional for the general practitioner data:</p>
<li> The general practitioner needs to have exactly one active (official) United States National Provider Identifier (NPI) identifier. </li>
<li> All other identifiers which are known for the practitioner, if any, also need to come from the NPI. But they need to be marked as ‚Äòold‚Äô. </li>
</ul>

### Steps to follow
1. Open the previously created Practitioner profile.
2. Slice the `identifier` element and add two slices.
3. Define the slicing details on the sliced root. They are differentiated by the value of `identifier.use`.
4. Define the two slices representing the above requirements. The naming system for the NPI can be found at HL7's [known identifier systems][1].
