# Step 7: Publish to Simplifier.net ðŸ“š 

Let's upload all the profiles to Simplifier.net and check if everything works as expected.

1. Create a Simplifier project (based on R4) if you haven't created one already: [create one here][2]

2. In Forge, click on your profile folder and hit the link button, and select your Simplifier project. Then, use the synchronize button to upload all your profiles.  
     * Project not shown? Check that the project is configured based on the same FHIR version as your profile.
3. Alternatively, you could zip your profile folder and upload the zib through the user interface on Simplifier.

If all went well, you should see the profiles in your project. You can check your profile constraints in the rendering as shown in the Overview tab of your profile. Selecting diff mode helps to pin down the made changes.
