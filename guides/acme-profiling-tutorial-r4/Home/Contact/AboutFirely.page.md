# Firely

This profiling tururial guide is a product of [Firely][1] and was created for [FHIR DevDays][2].

We are a group of software engineers, support engineers and FHIR consultants, based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Our customers are vendors, care providers and governments.

We have been involved in HL7 FHIR since day one and have been contributing to the standard ever since. We dream that one day every app in health care will speak FHIR. Thatâ€™s why we want to make FHIR even simpler. 

One of the ways in which we do this is by sharing knowledge on profiling across the FHIR community through this Profiling Academy.
